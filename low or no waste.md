# Low / No waste
Resorting to low to no waste methods not only reduces what goes to the landfill, but also allows you to save money, as well as being able to reduce spending at places you may not agree with.

**Consider!** Spending money is not always bad, it supports local businesses, these tips are designed to help you avoid giving money to more irresponsible businesses who may follow unethical practices.

## Kitchen
Here's some things you can do in the kitchen
* Reuse jars - Many jars are recycled once used. But these can be reused
  * Glasses - A jar can be reused as a glass for drinks
* Takeaway containers - These plastic containers are usually handy
  * Food storage - Of course, what it's designed for. May or may not include food from the takeaway
  * Storage for care packages - These small boxes are great for carrying small things like sewing kits and hydration tablets, see [homeless kits](/homeless bags.html) for more ideas.
