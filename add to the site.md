# Adding to MADD
If you would like to make or suggest any changes for MADD, here's how you can do it.

## Adding a page
At the bottom of every page on this site is an `Add new page` link. Doing this will take you to GitHub and allow you to add a new page. You'll be guided to make a pull request, where your work will be reviewed, and added to the site.

## Editing a page
At the bottom of each page is an `Edit this page`. It's much the same process as adding. If you make changes, you will be guided to make a pull request, where your work will be reviewed and added to the site.

## Pointing out an issue
If you see something you believe is inaccurate or shouldn't be there, you can make an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/makeadamndifference/makeadamndifference.github.io/issues).

If you would like to contribute to the site but don't know how, look at the issues! You may be able to find something you can work on.

Thank you. Together we'll make this world better <3
