# Homeless bags
Sometimes called homeless blessing bags or care packages, a homesless bag is simply a bag that includes some resources to help those are don't have anywhere to go. I personally in the past have given out bags containing:
- Umbrella (useful in blocking rain and intense sun)
- Suncream
- Water

Placed in a small carrier bag, these can be helpful, they can also easily be stored in the back of a car taking up very little room if you come across anyone homeless.

Times change, and weather varies between different locations, look up the best items to provide for conditions in your area.

If you don't drive a car or tend to bike to locations, consider you can still store a smaller number of things in small containers, like large pill bottles, or lunch boxes. Such things include:
- Sewing kits
- Hydration tablets
- Plasters / band aids

Again, be aware of what's best given the circumstances.
