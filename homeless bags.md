# Homeless bags
Sometimes called homeless blessing bags or care packages, a homesless bag is simply a bag that includes some resources to help those are don't have anywhere to go. I personally in the past have given out bags containing:
- Umbrella (useful in blocking rain and intense sun)
- Suncream
- Water

Placed in a small carrier bag, these can be helpful, they can also easily be stored in the back of a car taking up very little room if you come across anyone homeless.

Times change, and weather varies between different locations, look up the best items to provide for conditions in your area.

If you don't drive a car or tend to bike to locations, consider you can still store a smaller number of things in small containers, like large pill bottles, or lunch boxes. Such things include:
- Sewing kits
- Hydration tablets
- Plasters / band aids

Again, be aware of what's best given the circumstances.

Consider the following:
## Containers
Containers themselves are useful. Think about what will last, for example:
- Plastic containers (the small type you store food in)
- Light bags like backpacks (always useful)
- Plastic carrier bags (resilient)

On the other hand, bad containers may include:
- Paper bags (eco friendly, but delicate, and prone to damage when wet)
- Suitcases (useful for occasions, but generally very heavy and unpleasant to take through outdoor spaces)

## Information
It's not unheard to store names and addresses of locations that will help out a person in need. However, some people resort to giving out religious texts, I would personally advise against this, as someone may have religious trauma, or be on the street due to religious reasons (getting kicked out for being LGBTQ+ in a conservative household). In these cases, a person may be wary of anything else you provide them, especially names and locations.
